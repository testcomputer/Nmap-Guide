Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open source tool for network discovery and security testing, originally published by Gordon "Fyodor" Lyon.
The official website is (http://nmap.org). Nmap is a free and open source (licensed) utility for network discovery and security testing.
Many network and system administrators also find it useful for tasks such as inventorying the network, managing service upgrade schedules,
and monitoring server or service availability.
 Nmap uses raw IP packets in new ways to identify which servers are available on the network, what services (application names and versions)
 these servers provide, the operating system (and OS version) they provide. operating system) they are running, the type of packet
 filter/firewall used, and dozens of other features. It is designed for fast scanning of large networks, but works well on single servers.
 Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binaries are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.


<h1 align="center"> # Installation of Nmap

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
